# Learn JavaScript by Building a Blackjack Game

## Thoughts ðŸ’­

Creating a Blackjack game from scratch allowed me to dive deep into the core concepts of JavaScript. By working on this project, I effectively applied:

- **Arrays** for managing the deck of cards and player hands.
- **Objects** to represent each card and player.
- **Booleans** for game state management, such as tracking whether the game is ongoing or if a player has won.
- **If-else statements** for decision-making processes within the game, like determining the winner.
- **Comparison operators** to evaluate hand values and game outcomes.
- **Logical operators** to handle complex game logic.
- **For loops** for iterating through the deck and player actions.
- **The Math object** to shuffle the deck and generate random card draws.
- **Return statements** to output results and control game flow.

This project not only solidified my understanding of these fundamental concepts but also provided a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience that translated theoretical knowledge into practical application.
